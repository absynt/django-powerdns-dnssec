Installation as a microservice
====================================

Use pip to install ``django-powerdns-dnssec[dnsaas]``

..code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-powerdns-dnssec[dnsaas]

this will install all dependencies for the DNS-as-a-service microservice.

You can use the attached ``dnsaas/settings.py`` as a base for your configuration or use a ``settings_local.py``.
