Installation as a microservice
====================================

In order to install ``django-powerdns-dnssec`` as a microservice you can use
the attached ``dnsaas/settings.py`` as a base for your configuration. Use a
``settings_local.py`` or write your own ``settings.py`` configuration file
taking care to include all necessary django applications.
